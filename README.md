# Forecasting-of-Airlines-Passengers
 model explaining  how many dummy variables you have created and RMSE value for each model. Finally which model you will use for  Forecasting.
 
 
Conclusions:-
Simple Exponential Smoothing - The best smoothing level value is 0.24 and the model build on this value had an RMS error value is 11.01
Holt's Model - The best smoothing level value is 0.02 and smoothig slope value is 0.63. The model build on these parameters have an RMS error value is 10.25.
Holt-Winter-Method - Plotting both seasonal and trend to be multiplicative gives the best results. The model build with these parameters gives an RMS error is 1.85
From these conclusions we find that Holt Winters Model is the preffered model to go.
